### Features of MVP:

Player can move around a ship and fire bullets at asteroids,
destroying them. If they collide with an asteroid they lose a life.
The game ends when all lives have ran out.

### Out-of-scope
Destroying asteroids increases the score. Destroyed asteroids release
an explosion particle effect. Bigger asteroids split into smaller
asteroids when they are destroyed.
