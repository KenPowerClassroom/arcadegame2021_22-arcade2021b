### Features of MVP:

Player can move around a ship and fire bullets at asteroids,
destroying them. If they collide with an asteroid they lose a life.
The game ends when all lives have ran out.

### Out-of-scope
Destroying asteroids increases the score. Destroyed asteroids release
an explosion particle effect. Bigger asteroids split into smaller
asteroids when they are destroyed.

### List of stories needed to achieve MVP

1. As a player, I want there to be moving asteroids, to feel immersed in an asteroid belt

2. As a Spaceship Pilot, I want to move around, to avoid the asteroids
   
3. As a user I want to shoot asteroids to clear the screen

4. As a user I want to see my lives on screen so I can know how close I am to losing
