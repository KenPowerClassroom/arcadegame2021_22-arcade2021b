### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to detail our plan of the game before we get started with any code. To tell you who we are and who's in the project, also a brief description about the game and the basic rules of the game

### Why?

We are doing this project to get us used to working in a team based environment. We will use pair programming and various different types of pair programming to complete this project.This should help us, as we get to see how other people program first hand, learn from them, they can learn off of you and just get the hang of working in a team.
